For the bot to work you need to install the latest version of Python from the official website
https://www.python.org/

Next, open the console (cmd) and paste the following commands in order:
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
pip install win10toast
pip install os-win

For the bot to respond to your actions you need to:
1) To the file token.
txt insert your api_token without spaces and other symbols
2) In the username file, insert your name recorded in your telegram account

To add a bot to autorun you need:
1) Create a shortcut to the Start.bat file
2) Press the key combination Win+R
3) Insert shell:startup into the open menu
4) Transfer the previously created shortcut to the open folder
After these steps, you can close the folders

ATTENTION
I strongly recommend not spamming with the Shutdown and Lock commands because... this can lead to irreversible consequences.

Enjoy!
